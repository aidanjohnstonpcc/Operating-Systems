Compatibility with various types of software and hardware with Windows is quite expansive. For example, when plugging in peripherals, your Windows PC will install any necessary 
drivers to the system. You can also have Windows automatically search the internet to update any drivers currently installed. Windows is also compatible with an ocean of computer
hardware, many of such that can date back to the VERY early 2000s or even perhaps earlier.
